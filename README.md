# Academic journal editorial design

This repository contains examples of academic journals and some magazines' editorial designs. Its purpose is to inspire other journals' typesetters or designers, and to show the different paths they can take when designing their article templates.

**A note on article reuse:** all articles in this repo are open access; they are either from an open access journal or have been released after an embargo period. Consequently some articles are representative of journals as they were three or four years ago, not today.
